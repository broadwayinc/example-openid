# Google OAuth login, fetching Mail list

This is a simple web application that demonstrates how to use Google OAuth to login and fetch the user's mail list.

# Important

- Please replace the SERVICE_ID and OWNER_ID in the `srvc.js` file with your own values.
You can get these values by signing up, and creating your own service on [Skapi](https://www.skapi.com).

- Google OAuth requires a secure connection (HTTPS) to work. Host `index.html` and `srvc.js` in a https environment.
